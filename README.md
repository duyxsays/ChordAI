## Purpose of the project
To create an iOS application that uses computervison in order to recognise hand gestures and mapping the interact with chords made on a piano. The intended use use is for people who have no knowledge of musical theory.

## How To Use
You can start playing different chords in the western C Minor scale by showing your fingers to the camera. Each amount of fingers shown is mapped to a specifc chord. I.e. if you show 1 finger the playback will be a C Minor chord meaning pressing harmonic notes with eachother.
- C Minor chord = C - D# - G
